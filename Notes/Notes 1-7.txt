Notes 1-7 Game Design

-source paths are in script: of catergories
-class paths must also be added to flash develop
	project -> properties

as3 language reference: AS3LR (Documentation)

Check out custom search engines for firefox

coding standards:

asdoc - if your code comments are to spec, asdoc will parse the code for you into a html doc

f4 on class definition to jump to the class, shift f4 to return

look into code snippits for easy documentation

snippits are posted on blog post to be linked (also contains standards)

underscore means private variable?

$ implies function parameter (use in function parameter definitions)

next assignment implement coding standards

prefix public variables with this

as3 signals: 

-download zip from github
-copy org to src->classes
-import signal in code file
-a signal is a way for a child to make an announcement
-must be declared as variable of type Signal
(public var mySignal :Signal = new Signal();
-replace trace calls with this

ex

dispatch() announce event
add a listener to variable/class that cares to do something about the announced event

this.playbuttonclickedsignal.dispatch() ->sends the signal
->dispatch was added inside the function called by a standard event

this.playbuttonclickedsignal.add(fucntionname)->adds a signal handler
if you wnat to stop listening instead of add, remove

when you change visibility the thing that loses visibility should have a cleanup function that is called

-function parameters can be passed in signals
-parameter type should be added to parameter list in new declaration

__________________________________________________________________
**remember to add destroy functions

control 1 to add import


Enter frame event -> added to event listener
this.addEventListener(Event.theevent, fucntion to call)

in handler function: ex
if(keyboardmanager.instance.iskeydown(keycode.right)
{
	move the hero
}



this.mcCoin = new Coin() to add new object to memory
in game screen -> this.addChild(mcCoin);


Vector.<Coin> -> generic array of specific type, runs slower than array


Collision:
-add event listener
this.mcHero.hitTestObject(Object to check for collision against)

titlescreen->gamescreen play->here control for assignment 2
