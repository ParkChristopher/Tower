last assignment for this game due tue

Saving score:

Local Shared Object: (link for asdoc in todays notes w/tutorial)
-like a web browser cookie
(in init function or where its necessary)
var so:SharedObject SharedObject.getLocal("test");
trace("SharedObject is " + so.size + " bytes");

//
if(so.size == 0)
{
	so.data.highscore = 0;
}

so.data.anyvariablehere (created when you use it like an entry in an ini file)

example:

so.data.highscore = 100;

trace(so.data.highscore) //will output 100

Transitions between screens:
AbstractScreen -> show(); hide(); hide complete();

FadingScreen class extend AbstractScreen

-override show and hide

in show()

tweenmax.fromto(this, .5, {alpha:0} (start), {alpha:1, ease:Linear.easeNone}(end), onComplete:this.showComplete);

in hide:

do from 1 to 0 on alpha (use autoAlpha instead of alpha for visibility extreme controls

use this fadingscreen class as the extension parent for the screen you wnat to have the transition

in main: - link the hide start signal dispatch to starting a tween from show or hide so that it crossfades, or mix an match

Masks: use purple, easy to see
Note: you can add commands such as stop() in a frame on its own layer.

flicker - snippit that adds flicker to a graphic
parameters: sprite to flicker, duration in seconds, reapeat count

to use:
call this.flicker(referenceobject)


other things:
_______________________________________________________________

animation this.gotoAndPlay("animationnamelabel")

tweemax.delayedcall(time, functiontocall)


display utils - 
DisplayUtils.addLabelScript(mc, frameLabel, function to execute);
make sure you do this in destroy but pass null as the function to ensure garbage collection, otherwise it will not be called on the object


fancy mouse crap:

quotes around a number in tweenmax parameters makes it relative to the mc parameter, otherwise they are absolute;

right click guide on a layer to save its contents and have it not be in the game

Flint for particles.
