This week, increasing difficulty.
Improve rewards: (base stat increase)

loading an external file (xml)

-config file, controls starting values and difficulty progression
-add credit screen (with hyperlink and photo)


loading manager: loadermax (part of tween max)






in main:

this.load();(after keyboard)

//loads external files
protected function load():void
{
    (get code for xml loader and insert here)
	newXMLLoader("xml/config.xml", progressfunction call, oncomplete, error handling)
}

(3 functions are defined in example code (make private))

init function in main (called after load)
//initializes everything the game uses before beginning
(called in init handler?)
init()
{
	start title screen
}

___________________________

config.xml

<config>
  <scoring>
  </scoring>
  <gameobjects>
    <hero>
	<numLives>3</numLives><!-- comment -->
    </hero>
  </gameobjects>
</config>

to grab a value from the file in a class (ex hero class)
do it in either constructor or begin (begin preferred)

parseXML();

//update object data based on xml settings
protected function parseXML():void
{
    var xConfig:XML = LoaderMax.getContent("filename"); (trace to ensure proper load)

(one dot for each level in the xml heirarchy)
this.moveSpeed = (cast as expected type)xConfig.Gameobject.hero.movementspeed

(to get an attribute from an xml node: node.@attributename)
}

Advanced (FANCY!!!) XML: (E4x)
